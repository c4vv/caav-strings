# caav's Strings

This is my version of [Bill's Strings](https://forums.pokemmo.com/index.php?/topic/161519-custom-string%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%B8%F0%9F%87%AA%F0%9F%87%B8%F0%9F%87%AE%F0%9F%87%B9%F0%9F%87%AB%F0%9F%87%B7%F0%9F%87%A7%F0%9F%87%B7fastergyms-berrys-e4-region-speed-runlast-update-18-02-2024/page/6/#comment-2082881). They are the PVE version of his strings so they remove a lot of useful text if you are new to Pokemon, so I wouldn't recommend these if you don't have typings memorized, for example. I'm putting this on GH so I can keep everything in one place. If you also find these useful, feel free. Not taking requests for updates or other things.

Credit to credit nurver, realmadrid1809 and AnonymousPoke for the Unova Placeholder file that stops the strings from breaking the PokeMMO versions of strings with regular Bill's.

Credit to [rudes](https://github.com/rudes/PokeStrings) for most of the original trainer strings.

My personal customizations include:
- Modified charm names for easier searching
- Added custom file to fix broken raid boss move strings.
